# @serialport/binding-abstract

The bindings package has been renamed [`@serialport/bindings-interface`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@serialport/bindings-interface) and it's code has been moved out of the monorepo to it's [own repository](https://github.com/serialport/bindings-interface/).

This version of `@serialport/binding-abstract` is identical to the previous release but is deprecated to alert users of the name change.
